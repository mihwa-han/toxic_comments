## It is time to work!!!

- Ran Logistic Regression kaggle kernel -  using words n char ngrams -> KaggleClone_Logistic.ipynb

## 03/11/2018
- Tried running this kernel https://www.kaggle.com/ogrellier/wordbatch-fm-ftrl-using-mse-lb-0-9804 
- the wordbatch package is not compatible on my mac, ran it in pieces on kaggle itself. (Takes more than 60 minutes to run on kaggle)
- Took a weighted average between the Logistic Model and this one - LB .9814
