## It is time to work!!!

## 03/11/2018 (0.9847)
- submit several results from TOP10 kernels.
- best score is from 09th kernel (Toxic Avenger by the1owl) : 0.9814 - this is also based on the result of 08, which means 01 + 03 + 07 + 09 
       
- combine two kernels (03 + 06 + 09) : got the best score (0.9847) 
- next best score is 03 + 09:0.9828 next-next best score is from 03+08:0.9826

## 03/10/2018
- pick TOP10 kernels (put them in the other folder) and run most of them (put the public score in the title).
- start to learn from the first kernel.
- <b>TfidfVectorizer</b> - super cool package
- using <b>Naive Bayes feature</> - need to study more

## 03/09/2018 (0.9809 from 8th kernel)
- Starting this project!!
